Our goal is to help developers build <strong>faster</strong>, more <strong>resilient</strong> and more <strong>scalable</strong> applications.\n\n</p>\n\n## Features\n\n- **Mulitple protocols**:  Load-test HTTP, WebSocket and Socket.io applications\n- **Scenarios**: Support for complex *scenarios* to test multi-step interactions in your API or web app (great for ecommerce, transactional APIs, game servers etc)\n- **Perfomance metrics**: get detailed performance metrics (latency, requests per second, concurrency, throughput)\n- **Scriptable**: write custom logic in JS using any `npm` module\n- **Integrations**: `statsd` support out of the box for real-time reporting (integrate with [Datadog](http://docs.datadoghq.com/guides/dogstatsd/), [Librato](https://www.librato.com/docs/kb/collect/collection_agents/stastd.html), [InfluxDB](https://influxdata.com/blog/getting-started-with-sending-statsd-metrics-to-telegraf-influxdb/) etc)\n- **Extensible**: custom reporting plugins, custom protocol engines etc\n- **and more!** HTML reports, nice CLI, parameterization with CSV files\n\n---\n\n- **Source**: [https://github.com/shoreditch-ops/artillery](https://github.com/shoreditch-ops/artillery)\n- **Issues**: [https://github.com/shoreditch-ops/artillery/issues](https://github.com/shoreditch-ops/artillery/issues)\n- **Chat**: [https://gitter.im/shoreditch-ops/artillery](https://gitter.im/shoreditch-ops/artillery)\n- **Docs**: [https://artillery.io/docs/](https://artillery.io/docs/)\n- **Website**: [https://artillery.io](https://artillery.io)\n- **Twitter**: [@ShoreditchOps](https://twitter.com/shoreditchops)\n\n---\n\n- **Enterprise**: Run distributed tests from the cloud, integrate with CI/CD easily, and add support for enterprise features such as SOAP testing and extra authentication methods (SSL client auth, NTLM) with [Artillery Pro](https://artillery.io/pro/).\n- For training, custom integrations, and performance consulting services see our [professional services page](https://artillery.io/services-support.html).\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/shoreditch-ops/artillery.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/shoreditch-ops/artillery) [![gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/shoreditch-ops/artillery)\n\n# Use Cases\n\n- **Peak traffic testing** - ensure your e-commerce backend, IoT service or web API can handle max traffic\n- **Pre-launch load testing** - for new websites, mobile app backends, web APIs etc\n- **Continuous performance testing** for new microservices as they are being built\n- **Preventing performance regressions** - stop performance regressions due to new code or config changes before they are shipped to users\n- **Help profile & debug** common issues such as extensive GC pauses, memory leaks, improperly configured resource pools etc\n\nThere's a lot of fun to be had with a good load generator like Artillery.\n\n# [Get Started With Artillery](https://artillery.io/docs/getting-started/) üéØ\n\nüëâ&nbsp;&nbsp;[Artillery Getting Started Guide](https://artillery.io/docs/getting-started/)\n\n# Using Artillery?\n\nAre you using Artillery to ship faster, more resilient and more scalable systems?
